### Data Cleaning and Transformation Summary

| Variable | Description | Cleaning / Processing Method | Transformation Applied (In Code) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R** | Recession Indicator | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Filtered to sample window (1963Q1–2018Q2) | N/A |
| **CGDP** | Credit-to-GDP Ratio | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Filtered to sample window | A `.diff` transformation is applied for a first difference transformation (Δ) to this variable that was not stationary) |
| **CPIR** | Inflation Rate | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• **Aggregation:** Resampled Monthly data to Quarterly Mean | **Percentage Change**<br>Calculated as the percentage change from the previous quarter multiplied by 100. |
| **INVR** | Investment Growth | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Filtered to sample window | **Percentage Growth Rate**<br>Calculated as: $100 \times (\frac{Value_t}{Value_{t-1}} - 1)$ |
| **HP** | House Prices | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Filtered to sample window | **Log Difference**<br>Calculated as: $100 \times (\ln(HP_t) - \ln(HP_{t-1}))$<br>(Code saves this as `dHP_log`, loader renames it to `HP`).<br> Additionally, a `.diff` transformation is applied for a first difference transformation (Δ) to this variable that was not stationary|
| **IR** | Real Interest Rate | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Merged Nominal T-Bill rate with calculated CPIR | A `.diff` transformation is applied for a first difference transformation (Δ) to this variable that was not stationary|
| **ROP** | Profit Rate | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Filtered to sample window | N/A |
| **IROR** | Incremental Rate of Profit | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Merged Profits, Investment, and GDP Deflator series | Multiplied base data by 1,000,000 |
| **LSOI** | Labour's Share of Income | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Filtered to sample window | A `.diff` transformation is applied for a first difference transformation (Δ) to this variable that was not stationary)|
| **RGDP** | Real GDP | • Replaced `.` values with `NaN`<br>• Filtered to sample window | **Percentage Growth Rate**<br>Calculated as: $100 \times (\frac{GDP_t}{GDP_{t-1}} - 1)$<br>*(Loader keeps the `RGDP_growth` column)* |
| **MA** | Manufacturing PMI | • **Date Parsing:** Converted text dates (e.g., in `Quarter` column) to standard Quarterly PeriodIndex (`Q-DEC`) | N/A |
| **TOBQ** | Tobin’s Q | • **Date Parsing:** Converted text dates to standard Quarterly PeriodIndex (`Q-DEC`) | N/A |
